Heart Rate Monitor & Tracker uses your phone’s camera to make a heart rate measurement. It also logs the highest active and lowest resting readings of the day to be charted over time. Data saved in the app’s local storage is used for creating the trend chart. No data is collected, used, or shared by us.
